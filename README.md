Setting Up The Windows 10 Victim Machine
Using the Windows 10 Installation Media Creation Tool, created a Windows 10 ISO file
Set up the virtual machine in Oracle VMBox, walked through the installer

I then set up a new isolated network within KVM. This allows me to use my VMs on an network that is logically seperate from my host machine and the internet. I did this for safety to
minimize the risk of any unwanted traffic traversing outside of the virtuals machines.
